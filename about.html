        <h2>WordPress Professional</h2>
        <p>My interest in creating websites began in 2013. After learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through a combination of taking online courses and building my personal web technology library, I began using my skills to update Wordpress websites. PHP was later added to my skillset along with working knowledge of creating custom plugins and page templates. In 2015, I founded a small WordPress agency.</p>
        <h2>Small Business Consultant</h2>
        <p>In 2017, I volunteered 104 hours to SCORE (Fort Worth, TX), a non-profit organization that provides free services to small business owners. As a cerfified small business coach I used my expertise as a WordPress developer to educate and mentor small business owners on how to create and manage a business website.</p>
        <h2>Continuing Education</h2>
        <p>Continuing education is important because web technology is always changing. As of September 2018, I am earning my front end web development certificate. My goal is to complete this training no later than March 2019. Once completed, I will begin taking courses toward a certificate in full stack web development.</p>
